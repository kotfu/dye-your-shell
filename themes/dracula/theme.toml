# definition of dracula theme

# theme file stuff to work out
# - how to declare a "whatever your terminal chooses" color
#     - fzf uses -1 for this
#     - rich uses "default"

# information heirarchy
# 'styles'
# 'domains'
#    domain - ie fzf
#       - domain_type
#    element - ie label
#    value - ie '$ff79c6'
#
# - domain can be the name of a  and element could be the color
# - domain could be the name of an environment variable, and element could be the value

# styles defined here use the syntax of the python rich library

# these are the only things fzf supports background colors for

# the fzf module uses the bw base scheme, with turns all colors off
# if you don't specify a color here, it will draw in your terminal
# default foreground color

# fzf only supports a few background colors, and they are notated
# separately from the foreground
# so we map the following:
#   text -> fg and bg
#   current_line -> fg+ and bg+
#   preview -> preview-fg and preview-bg
# background colors on all other styles are ignored
#

# these styles are special because they set
style.text = "text"

# no special parsing for these styles, just use the fzf color name
